// WebGpuWater - water-driven spray emitter ("spray pump").
//
// Floats one or more probe points on the water surface and throws spray through the shared
// WaterSplashEmitter wherever a probe and the surface under it move sharply against each other. Unlike
// WaterSplash (which fires only when a Rigidbody punches DOWN through the waterline, so a stationary
// object stays silent), this reads the water's motion relative to each tracked point.
//
// Each probe carries its own mode, so one object can mix a Boat-mode bow row with Rock-mode points:
//   - Rock : reacts to how fast the WATER rises toward the point (incoming waves/ripples included) -
//            a fixed rock or pier throwing spray as a wave slams it.
//   - Boat : reacts to the point driving into the water - both a vertical plunge AND, via
//            horizontalPlowWeight, horizontal speed across flat water (bow spray) - sampled against the
//            analytic surface only, so a hull's own emitted wake can't re-trigger it.
//   - Both : fires on either source (rising water OR a moving point).
//
// Step 7 of the "WOW pass": flat-water plow. A bow gliding fast over calm water has no vertical motion,
// so the earlier closing-speed signal missed it; horizontalPlowWeight scales the point's own horizontal
// ground speed into the Boat/Both trigger (0 = off, vertical motion only).
//
// All same-sampling probes are gathered into one batched WaterVolume.SampleHeights call into reused
// buffers (at most two: ripples-included and analytic-only), so an N-probe pump allocates nothing per frame.
