// WebGpuWater - real underwater fog (URP RenderGraph fullscreen).
// Fogs only the part of each camera->scene ray that is actually IN the water, so it reads as a
// volume and a waterline falls out for free (a ray that never enters the water gets no fog):
//   * Ocean (unbounded): the below-surface half-space -> the fullscreen screen effect.
//   * Pond  (bounded):   the ray clipped to the pool box (pool space [-1,1] xz, [-1,0] y) via
//                        IntersectCube -> a finite fog volume you can circle around.
// Per-channel Beer-Lambert absorption + downwelling depth darkening, reusing the body's fog and
// depth globals. Two hardware-blend passes so the scene colour never has to be copied:
//   0 Absorb:    scene *= pathTransmittance * depthAttenuation   (Blend Zero SrcColor)
//   1 Inscatter: scene += fog * (1 - pathTransmittance) * depthAttenuation   (Blend One One)
// Driven by WaterUnderwaterFogFeature (gated on WaterVolume.UnderwaterFogActive: ocean = submerged
// only, pond = whenever Water Fog is on). U2: per-pixel wave-aware waterline - the surface crossing follows crests/troughs.
// U3: quality-tier Simple mode (_UnderwaterFogSimple, a uniform so every pixel takes the same branch):
// the closed-form flat waterline at _UnderwaterSurfaceY replaces the per-pixel crossing march - the
// budget path for WebGPU/mobile tiers. Same absorption/inscatter/darkening either way.

        // (FogArmBandMeters) now has that same property for free.
        //
        // WHAT THIS REPLACES: a camera-height arm fade - a 0.25 m ramp on cam.y against the
        // surface at the EYE's xz, plus a "lens exemption" keyed on how near this ray's water
        // began. Two faults. It dimmed the WHOLE SCREEN together as the camera neared the surface
        // (one global number, so every pixel moved at once - the transition band reading as weird);
        // and the lens exemption held steeply-down-looking rays at FULL fog right up to the frame
        // the gate toggled off, because their crossing is only ~0.5 m away - the pop as the water
        // reached the camera.
        //
        // Above-water pixels lose nothing by being masked out: the surface shader already applies
        // the water column's absorption for a view from above (its own transmittance +
        // WaterDepthClarity), exactly as Crest's Fragment.hlsl and KWS's fragWater do. The
        // fullscreen pass painting them was double-counting that.
        //
        // FEATHERED over one pixel instead of a hard discard: both references hide their hard edge
        // under a far wider meniscus than ours (Crest ~11% of screen height on the air side, KWS a
        // 40-80 px blurred band; ours defaults to 5 px), so our boundary itself has to be clean.
        // The meniscus pass evaluates the IDENTICAL gap, so the line it draws and this edge are the
        // same curve by construction - there is no seam between them to hide.
        //
        // Derivative safety: every early-out below is on a UNIFORM global (_UnderwaterUnbounded,
        // _CameraDryVolume, _UnderwaterFogSimple), and this is called before any per-pixel
        // marching, so fwidth sits in uniform control flow.

        // NEAR-CLIP-PLANE position - Crest's mask, verbatim.
        //
        // Inside a dry carve that point is useless: the lens sits in AIR below sea level, so its
        // waterline says nothing about the water it is looking at through the pane. The previous
        // answer was to give up and return full coverage, citing Crest disabling its camera-height
        // heuristics under a portal. That was a misreading. Crest disables the height RAMPS; it
        // never disables the MASK - it MOVES it onto the portal geometry, classifying the portal
        // WALL's world position against the water line (Portals.hlsl Fragment: `positionWS.y <=
        // height ? -1 : 1`, fed by a height field fitted to the portal bounds).

        // Same move here, analytically: push the ray to where it LEAVES the carve and classify
