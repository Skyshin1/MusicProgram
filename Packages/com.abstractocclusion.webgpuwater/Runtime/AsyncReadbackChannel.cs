// WebGpuWater - shared async GPU readback channel.
//
// WaterOceanFft and WaterSurfaceSampler carried byte-identical readback state machines: a single
// in-flight request flag, a cached completion delegate, and a consecutive-error streak that - at
// the same threshold in both - latches an "unsupported" fallback so a backend that persistently
// errors doesn't retry silently forever. One implementation here so the throttling and give-up
// semantics can never drift between owners. What to DO with landed data (buffer copy, region
// bookkeeping) stays with each owner via the per-request onLanded callback.
